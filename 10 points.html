        <h1 align="center"><u>web &nbsp development</u> </h1>

        <p align="center"><b> Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World
            Wide
            Web) or an
            intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static pageof
            plain
            text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive
            list
            of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content
            development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web serverand network security
            configuration,
            and e-commerce development.

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
            sites:
            writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems(CMS) to make content
            changes
            easier and available with basic technical skills.

            For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
            developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
            organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
            related
            job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
            collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
            kinds of Web developer specialization: <b> front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer</b>. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
            browser,
            while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>

        <h1 align="center"><u>front end developer</u></h1>
        <p align="center"><b>Front-end web development</b> , also known as client-side development is the practice of
            producing
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
            directly. A front-end developer architects and develops websites and applications using web technologies
            (i.e.,
            HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript), which run on the Open Web Platform or act as compilation input for non-web
            platform environments (i.e., React Native)</p>

        <h1 align="center"><u>back end developer</u></h1>
        <p align="center"> <b>Back-end Development</b> refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases,
            scripting,
            website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action on a
            website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by back-end
            developers helps browsers to communicate with database information Most common example of Backend
            programming is
            when you are reading an article on the blog. The fonts, colors, designs, etc. constitute the frontend of
            this
            page. While the content of the article is rendered from a server and fetched from a database. This is the
            backend part of the application</p>

        <h1><u>HTML</u></h1>
        <p><b> The HyperText Markup Languageor HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
            displayed in a
            web browser</b>. It can be assisted by technologies such as <b> Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)</b> and scripting languages
            such
            as <b> JavaScript Web browsers</b> receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
            documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for the appear</p>
        <hr width="500" size="3" color="black" noshade>
        <h1><u>css</u></h1>
        <p> <b> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) </b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
            document written
            in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
            and
            JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
            colors,
            and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
            the
            relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
            enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
            its
            formatting.</p>

        <h1><u>java Script</u></h1>
        <p><b> JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming languagethat is one of the
            core
            technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <b> HTML and CSS </b>.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the
            client side for web page behavior,[12]often incorporating third-party libraries.[13]All major web browsers
            have
            a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices JavaScript is a high-level, often
            just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
            prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
            event-driven,
            functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
            with
            text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model(DOM).</p>

        <h1><u>Java</u></h1>
        <p><b> Java is a high-level , class-based, object-oriented programming language</b> that is designed to have as
            few
            implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
            programmers write once, run anywhere(WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
            that
            support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that
            can
            run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java
            is
            similar to <b> C and C++,</b> but has fewer low-levelfacilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides
            dynamic
            capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in
            traditional
            compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular <b> programming languages in use according to
            GitHub,[19][20]particularly for client–server web applications </b>, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

        <h1><u>Pythone</u></h1>
        <p><b> Python is a high-level , general-purpose programming language</b>. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-orientedapproach aim
            to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.[29 Python is
            dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
            (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries
            included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[30][31]</p>

        <h1><u>C Language</u></h1>
        <p><b> C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language</b> supporting
            structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C
            provides
            constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications
            previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systemsand various application
            software for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.</p>

        <h1><u>C++ Language</u></h1>
        <p><b> C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language</b> created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension
            of
            the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and
            modern
            C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level
            memorymanipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
            compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is
            available
            on many platforms.[10]</p>
