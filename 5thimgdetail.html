    <p>The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini (stylized as iPhone 13 mini) are smartphones designed, developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc. They are the fifteenth generation of iPhones (succeeding the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Mini). They were unveiled at an Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 14, 2021, alongside the higher priced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max flagships. Pre-orders for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini began on September 17, 2021. They became available on September 24, 2021.[13]

        The iPhone 13 has a flat chassis analogous to that of contemporaneous Apple products, some differences such as the rear cameras being larger and arranged diagonally. The Face ID TrueDepth sensor housing on the iPhone is 20% smaller yet taller than its predecessors.[14]

The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are available in six colors: Midnight, Starlight, Product Red, Blue, Pink, and Green.[15][16]

On March 8, 2022, at Apple's Special Event “Peek Performance”, Apple revealed a new Green color option which will become available on March 18.[15][16]

Specifications
Hardware
The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini use an Apple-designed A15 Bionic system on a chip. The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a 6-core CPU, 4-core GPU and 16-core Neural Engine, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature a 5 core GPU.[17]

Display
The iPhone 13 features a 6.1-inch (15 cm) display with Super Retina XDR OLED technology at a resolution of 2532×1170 pixels and a pixel density of about 460 PPI with a refresh rate of 60Hz. The iPhone 13 Mini features a 5.4-inch (14 cm) display with the same technology at a resolution of 2340×1080 pixels and a pixel density of about 476 PPI.

Cameras
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing camera (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image stabilization (OIS) on main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of vertically to engineer the larger sensors.[citation needed]

The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose from a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple clarifies this is different than a filter, because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos unlike filters which can be removed after applying.[citation needed]

The camera app contains a new mode called Cinematic Mode, which allows users to rack focus between subjects and create shallow depth of field using software algorithms. It is supported on the wide and front-facing cameras in 1080p at 30 fps.[citation needed]

Software
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini were shipped with iOS 15 at launch.[citation needed]

Repairability
Some iPhone 13 parts are paired to the motherboard. The user is warned if a paired component (e.g. screen, battery) is replaced by independent repair shops. The Face ID sensors completely cease to function upon third party replacement. Apple technicians have a proprietary software tool to pair components.[18][19]
