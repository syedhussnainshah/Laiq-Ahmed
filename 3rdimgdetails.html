    <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight
        ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. The game takes
        place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows:
        players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so
        that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball
        within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits
        an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.

        Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in
        1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the
        ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988
        until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team
        event has been played instead of the doubles.</p>
