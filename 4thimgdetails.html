    <p>Ma Long is arguably one of the best two winged looper in the history of the game. After winning Junior and youth championships for China, Ma Long broke into the ITTF Pro tour at 17 years. In the Final of 2005 German open against Samsonov, at 3 games all and 6-6 there was a faint edge favoring Samsonov which the umpire did not notice, MA Long to his credit advised the umpire that the ball had touched. SAMSONOV and the crowd applauded the teenager; it was a magnificent display of sportsmanship from the young Ma who would go on to rule the Table tennis world.
