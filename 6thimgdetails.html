    <h1><u>about hacking</u></h1>
    <img src="download (1).jpg" width="70%" alt="">

    <p>A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or
        overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become
        associated in popular culture with a security hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or
        exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be unavailable to them – hacking
        can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes
        use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include
        using anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals
        themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their
        work. Oppositely, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security
        agencies (conducting warrantless activities), and employed by State actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal
        warfare.

        General definition
        Reflecting the two types of hackers, there are two definitions of the word "hacker":

        Originally, hacker simply meant advanced computer technology enthusiast (both hardware and software) and
        adherent of programming subculture; see hacker culture.[3]
        Someone who is able to subvert computer security. If doing so for malicious purposes, the person can also be
        called a cracker.[4]
        Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word
        since the 1990s.[5] This includes what hacker slang calls "script kiddies", people breaking into computers using
        programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so
        predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.[6] While the
        self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers,
        people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize
        the difference between the two by calling security breakers "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker)</p>
